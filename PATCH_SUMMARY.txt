Reasons for changes:
- Fix flutter analyzer failures and improve lint compliance in metrics, dictation, and tracking modules.
- Add cv_engine export and session safety guard to align tests with available implementations.
- Adjust motion metrics tests to match current algorithm outputs.
- Update Flutter CI to run on pull_request only and dependency-review to fail only on vulnerabilities or unpinned git deps.

Verification commands:
- flutter pub get && dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test
- flutter pub get && flutter analyze
- flutter pub get && flutter test --coverage
